  "Description": "QPluginLoader in Qt versions 5.0.0 through 5.13.2 would search for certain plugins first on the current working directory of the application, which allows an attacker that can place files in the file system and influence the working directory of Qt-based applications to load and execute malicious code. This issue was verified on macOS and Linux and probably affects all other Unix operating systems. This issue does not affect Windows.",
